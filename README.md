# Ball tracking

Develop your own code based on linear algebra to track a ball in a sequence of pictures.

- Generate a timesequence of a 3 dimensional dataset (2 spatial 1 time), of a "Ball" moving.
- Develop an algorithm based on Linear Algebra (Matrix operations) to track the position of the ball in time.
